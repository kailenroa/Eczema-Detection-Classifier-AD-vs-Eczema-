# Eczema-Detection-Classifier-AD-vs-Eczema-
This project looks at how an image-based AI model can distinguish eczema from atopic dermatitis. I chose this topic because these skin conditions look very similar and are often misclassified. The results show where the model struggles and how explainability and tuning help improve understanding, not diagnosis.
